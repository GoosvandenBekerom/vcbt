# vcbt - Visual Cloud Bigtable

`vcbt` is a cli tool inspired by [cbt](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/cbt-reference) that aims to give a nicer visual representation of data in a Google Cloud Bigtable table.

## Installing

for now, there is nothing in place for fancy installing. Simply install from source to try.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:GoosvandenBekerom/vcbt.git
$ cd vcbt
$ go mod tidy
$ go build
$ ./vcbt -help
```
